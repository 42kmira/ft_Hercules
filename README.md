A series of different odd task. Mostly based around Unix. These include setting up cron task, remote ssh into a server, stopping a rouge bash script, fixing C code, setting up a terminal connection to send messages across a network, and more. These projects were done under timed constraints. For most of them we had only the weekend (two days) before the submission cutoff. They were also topics that I was unfamiliar with and had to learn in those two days, so be warned.

But overall I had a lot of fun venturing into unfamiliar territory and learned some things along the way.
